# LexLets Management

Software to manage Inventory, Sales, Accounts &amp; Customers for my wife's jewellery business.

This was my first ever C# application. I wrote it as I was learning so it has changed many times. Unfortuantly I knew nothing about GitHub at the time of writing
hence the lack of commits.

It's made using Winforms and SQL. 

Looking back now the code isn't great, however the program works very well.

You can view the software in use here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MenOfgBFBYg&feature=youtu.be

or download it and try it yourself.
