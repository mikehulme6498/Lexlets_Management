# LexLets Jewelley Store Management System

Software to manage inventory, sales, accounts &amp; customers for my wife's jewellery business.

This was my first ever C# application. I Wrote it whilst learning, so the code is a little inconsistent and incredibly tightly coupled. I had not heard of entity framework at the time so I also had to learn SQL as well. At the time For my level of coding skills, this was a huge project. In fact, I had no idea where to start. So the whole project was a huge learning curve. This is why it is still one of my proudest projects. It is still used to this day to manage the business.

It's made using Winforms and SQL. 

Looking back now the code isn't great, however, the program works very well.
